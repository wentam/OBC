# OBC (Open Bike Computer)

OBC is open-source, community driven bike computer software being developed for android-based bike computers.

Currently only the wahoo elemnt bolt is supported as we're in the early stages.

# Goals
* Support as many devices as possible! This should include android phones.
* Extremely configurable, driven by a config file -- make it do whatever you want!
* Map renderer that produces output that is easily understandable and includes all needed information such as street names
* As much as possible should be possible on the device itself, including routing to new destinations. A bike computer should be able to stand on it's own.
* Involve the bicycle community in the development of the project as much as possible. Let us know what you want your bike computer to do!
